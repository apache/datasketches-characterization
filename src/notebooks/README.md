# Python Notebooks

These Python notebooks contain the code for generating the plots from
some of the JAva characterization experiments.
The notebooks require basic Python data analysis libraries such as:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- jupyter
The packages and their dependencies are included in the
`requirements.txt` file in case you need to make a new virtual environment.
