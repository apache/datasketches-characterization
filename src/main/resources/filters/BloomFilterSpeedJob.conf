# The Bloom Filter Update Speed profile is evaluated by choosing a maximum input cardinality.
# From this input cardinality N, and a target false positive probability Fpp, we evaluate
# ```
# final long numItems = 1L<<20;
# final double targetFpp = 1E-6 ;
# long numBits = BloomFilterBuilder.suggestNumFilterBits(numItems, targetFpp);
# final short numHashes = BloomFilterBuilder.suggestNumHashes(numItems, numBits);
# ```
# and then use these parameters for the filter configuration at the bottom of this file.
# Note that `final long numItems = 1L<<20` should correspond direclty with `Trials_lgMaxU`
# in this configuration file.
